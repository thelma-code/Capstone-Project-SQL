SQL analysis project for Kultra Mega Stores order data (2009-2012)

## Project Title: Business Intelligence Analysis of Kultra Mega Stores (2009-2012)

### Project Overview
This project analyzes historical order data from Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), a Lagos based company specializing in office supplies and furniture, with a focus on its Abuja division. Using SQL Server, I performed an analysis of sales trends, customer behavior, regional performance and shipping cost efficiency from 2009-2012.

### Data Source
This data was provided by The Incubator Hub as part of the final project requirements for the Digital SkillUp Africa Program.

### Tools Used
- SQL Server

### Project Objectives
- Identify top-performing product categories and regions
- Analyze sales and shipping patterns
- Uncover high-value and low-value customers
- Evaluate if shipping costs align with order priorities
- Provide actionable recommendations to management

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as:
1. What are the top-performing product categories and regions?
2. Who are the most and least valuable customers?
3. Which customer segments are underperforming?
4. Are high-priority orders receiving appropriate shipping methods?
5. How can revenue be increased from low-spending customers?

### Key Insights
- The bottom 10 customers are mostly from the Consumer Segment(Home Offices/Small Businesses) typically purchasing only Office Supplies(likely low margin items like Paper, Pens, Folders etc)
- Low-Priority orders were sometimes shipped via Express Air, increasing costs unnecessarily.
- Shipping modes did not always align with order priority potentially wasting money and risking customer dissatisfaction on urgent/High Priority Orders.
